## Secure Email Solution Built on the Ethereum Blockchain

Email is the backbone of professional communication within organizations because it allows people to easily communicate and share data instantly. Since email was initially designed to be accessible, lightweight, and easy to use, unfortunately security is not heavily considered in email communication protocols [1]. In order to tackle this issue, many organizations are requiring additional levels of security to be implemented on top of current email systems, such as spam filters and encryption methods.

As a proof of concept, this project will demonstrate how email could be re-imagined from a security-first approach using blockchain technology [2]. This may involve the deployment of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain and message signatures and encryption using public key cryptosystems.
